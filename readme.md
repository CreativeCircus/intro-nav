# The Hamburger Menu

## 1. Based on circus-starter
So clone a copy, `cd` into the folder, `npm install`, and `gulp` to get it going.

## 2. Take a look at the `assets/js/main.js` file.
Your homework is to make this hamburger menu work (make it open the nav when you click the hamburger). After that, make it look nice and add some fun.
The HTML is done. The CSS is done, but basic. The JS is all yours.
